## Dress Code Recommendation Based on Weather

### Introduction

The primary objective of this application is to simplify and enhance the daily clothing selection process by offering users personalized dress code recommendations that align with current weather conditions. Users can simply edit their profiles to provide us with their preferred dressing style, and our app will use weather condition data as input to generate outfit suggestions, helping users make informed decisions. Additionally, users can share outfit ideas and fashion tips with others on our platform.

### Data Sources

- Weather Data:
  - [NOAA Weather](https://www.noaa.gov/weather)
  - [Tomorrow.io Weather API](https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api/)

## Personalized Recipe Recommendation System

### Introduction

Our application proposal revolves around a personalized recipe recommendation system. Users can input their daily food preferences, available ingredients, and desired calorie intake for a meal. User profiles may also include specific dietary restrictions (such as allergies) set during sign-up, stored in the user database. Recipe recommendations take into consideration factors such as seasonal food availability, local climate, or events that might influence food choice. Additionally, the application utilizes third-party authentication (e.g., WeChat, Twitter, or Facebook) to correlate users' preferences with at least two publicly available datasets via the internet to produce unique recipe suggestions.
