Dress code recommendation based on weather
The primary objective of this application is to simplify and enhance the daily clothing selection process by offering users personalized dress code recommendations that align with current weather conditions. The users just need to edit the profiles that provide us with their preferred dressing style and our App will take the weather condition data as the input to generate outfit suggestions to help users make decisions. Users can also share outfit ideas and fashion tips with others on our platform.

A Personalized Recipe Recommendation System
The proposal of our application is a personalized recipe recommendation system. Users type or choose(input) their daily food preferences, available ingredients, and desired calorie intake for a meal. Their profile might also include specific dietary restrictions (such as allergies) set during sign-up, and this information is stored in the database of each user. Our recommendation of recipes could also related to seasonal food availability, local climate, or events that might influence food choice. The application also uses third-party authentication like WeChat, Twitter, or Facebook, in order to correlate users' preferences with at least two publicly available datasets via the Internet to produce a unique recipe suggestion.
