## Personalized Recipe Recommendation System

### Introduction

Our application revolves around a personalized recipe recommendation system. 
Users can input their daily food preferences, available ingredients, and desired calorie intake. User profiles may also include specific calorie restrictions (such as 600-800 cal) by using filters. 
Users can also read health news and search for key terms to read health-related articles. 
Additionally, users can assess their BMI, and our website suggests trying the Copenhagen diet and Harvard Vegetable Soup. 
Furthermore, the application utilizes both sign-up and third-party authentication (e.g., Google account) to log in. User data is stored in MySQL.
