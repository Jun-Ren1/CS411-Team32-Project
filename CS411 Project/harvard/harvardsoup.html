        <h2>What is Harvard Vegetable Soup?</h2>

        <p>"Harvard Vegetable Soup" is a recipe developed by Dr. Hiroshi Takahashi, a former professor at Harvard University specializing in cancer and immunology. The recipe consists of easily obtainable ingredients throughout the four seasons: cabbage, onions, carrots, and pumpkin. By heating and cooking, "phytochemicals" dissolve into the water, making it easy to obtain complete nutrition.</p>

        <h2>What are "phytochemicals"?</h2>
        <p>Phytochemicals are the immune system of plants. They are essential elements for plant growth and are sources of natural pigments and substances for plant odors in various colors. Phytochemicals provide plants with self-protection functions against various diseases, insects, natural enemies, etc.</p>
        <p>For humans, although phytochemicals are non-essential nutrients, because the human body cannot produce phytochemicals on its own, they must be obtained from various foods. If various fruits and vegetables are consumed, and an adequate amount of phytochemicals is ingested, it can affect the regulation of human genes, enhance the body's resistance, reduce the likelihood of illness, and even help suppress the occurrence of cancer.</p>

    <section id="when-to-drink">
        <h2>When to Drink</h2>
        <p>It is recommended to drink a cup of vegetable soup before meals, especially on an empty stomach in the morning, as phytochemicals are more easily absorbed and utilized by the body. At the same time, it can slow down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, helping to inhibit the rise in blood sugar levels. Eating various vegetables with the soup can also intake a large amount of dietary fiber, which helps prevent diseases caused by poor lifestyle habits, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.</p>
